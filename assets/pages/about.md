Hey, this website is a collection of things I wish someone would have shown me. My experience has been after college is over, after the boot camp ends. That is where you gain real-world experience. Corporate America taught me many things. Contracting taught me even more. I will share that with you here. Welcome to Jr Dev! If you don't like blogs go to the Youtube channel.
